1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,360
Oh, Martini will move against you first. He'll

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,349
set up a meeting with someone that you absolutely trust

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,210
guaranteeing your safety. And at that meeting, you'll

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:24,449
be assassinated. I like to drink mine more than

5
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,559
I used to. Anyway, I'm thinking more.

6
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:39,520
It's good for you, But I don't know your

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,950
wife until I'm the happy with them. Very happy

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,490
. That's good. Mhm. I hope you don't

9
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,399
mind the way I keep going over this pass.

10
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,049
Any business? No, not at all. It's

11
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,740
an old habit. I spent my life trying not

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,689
to be careless. Women and Children can be careless

13
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,659
, but not men. Mhm. How's your boy

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,030
? It's good. You know, it looks more

15
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,390
like every day. Yeah. You're smarter than I

16
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,180
am. Three years old. He can read the

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:30,060
funny papers. Read the funny papers. Mm hmm

18
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,230
. Uh huh. I want you to arrange to

19
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,920
have a telephone, man, check all the calls

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,349
ago. You know I did it already, Bob

21
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,390
. Good care of that. Oh, that's right

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,829
. I forgot. What's the matter? What's bothering

23
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:57,829
you? I'll handle it. I told you I

24
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:14,139
can handle it. I'll handle it. I knew

25
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,280
that Santino was going to have to go through all

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,849
this I'm afraid of. Uh huh. Fred,

27
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,229
I was no, and I never I never wanted

28
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:32,030
this for you. I want my own life.

29
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,849
I don't apologize to take care of my family.

30
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,039
And I refused. Therefore dancing on the string held

31
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,280
by all those big shots. Mhm. I don't

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,060
apologize. That's my life. But I thought that

33
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,120
mhm But when it was your time that the Jew

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,090
would be the one that all the strings Senator Corleone

35
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:07,360
, Governor Corleone, something another person alive and well

36
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,759
, this wasn't enough time. Michael was enough time

37
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,050
. We'll get there, Pop. We'll get them

38
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,580
. Mm. Yeah, yeah. Now, listen

39
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,949
, Whoever comes to you with this bars, any

40
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:31,759
meeting, he's a trader. Don't forget that.
